I am excited to announce that I have been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2025 with MDAnalysis and WESTPA. My project aims to utilise MDAnalysis trajectory streaming to analyse many trajectories from Weighted Ensemble simulations on-the-fly. This will reduce analysis overhead and decrease the time between iterations.
