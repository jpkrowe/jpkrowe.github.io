In the last blog post, I discussed the creation of a test system to evaluate the performance improvement of streaming the WESTPA trajectories. In that post I was using the chignolin protein as a test system. Using this system as a benchmark, I found that there was no significant performance improvement from analysing on-the-fly versus analysing after the simulation was finished. To diagnose the lack of improvement, I timed the analysis script in order to identify whether any speed up would be expected from the streaming approach. Timing the analysis script revealed that the script only takes 3.3 seconds to run. This explains why no speed up was seen from the streaming approach as this time is insignificant compared to the simulation time. Even though in this analysis we are calculating a number of pairwise distances the small size of the chignolin protein means that the computational cost of the analysis is low and therefore no speed up is seen.
